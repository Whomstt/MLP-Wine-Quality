# MLP - Wine Quality Regression
## Description
Implemented a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict wine quality from chemical properties such as alcohol content and pH. Using normalized data from red and white wine datasets, the model was trained with two hidden layers and optimized with mean squared error and the Adam optimizer. Five-fold cross validation ensured consistent performance. Hyperparameters were tuned to balance accuracy and overfitting. The model achieved about 60 percent accuracy for exact quality prediction and over 95 percent within one point.
